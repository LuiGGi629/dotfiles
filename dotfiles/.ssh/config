# To generate keys:
#   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -C ''

Compression yes

# Allow connection sharing
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath /tmp/ssh_%h_%p_%r

# Keep all connexions open for 3 hours
# Depending of your version of OpenSSH this might not work in combination with the ForwardAgent
#     option, and you'll get errors like "Bad packet length 1397966893".

# Always force canonicalization of host names.
CanonicalizeHostname yes

CanonicalizeMaxDots 0

# Always show keys in ASCII art
VisualHostKey yes

# Beware of SSH configuration algorithm: it only applies options from
# subsequent matching sections if and only that option has not been defined by
# previous sections. Which means it will always use the FIRST value given for
# each option. This is perfectly detailed in:
